#Google Voice SMS Plugin

This plugin allows you to send SMS messages via any number of Google Voice accounts. It will also insert the last SMS message received by an account into a state in the account device that can be used as a trigger.

This plugin was originally developed by Chris Baltas who has given us permission to open-source the plugin for the community.

##Downloading for use

Once it's downloaded just open that folder and double-click on the "GoogleVoiceSMS.indigoPlugin" file to have the client install and enable it for you.
